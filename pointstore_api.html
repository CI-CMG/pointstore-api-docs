<h1>Crowdsourced Bathymetry Pointstore API</h1>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p><em>This application in active development and is being offered as a technology preview. No expectations should be made as to it's availability and the API may change prior to public release.</em></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This API exposes one resource, <em>order</em>, which represents a request to extract a subset of soundings from the pointstore and optionally grid them. The soundings are delivered as points in a comma separated value (CSV) format file. The generated grid is provided in a user specified format and resolution.</p>
<p>The process is asynchronous with the flow being:</p>
<ol>
<li>submit order via HTTP POST request. The response to the POST request will contain an acknowlegement if order is accepted and an URL that can be used to check processing status.</li>
<li>Once the order is complete, an email will be received with pickup instructions. Processing time is generally less than 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Limitations and known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>if a grid is requested there is a limit on the number of points and grid cells which can be processed.</li>
<li>the area of interest (i.e. bounding box) cannot cross the antimeridian</li>
<li>base URL is temporarily hosted at https://q81rej0j12.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/</li>
</ul>
<h2>API</h2>
<p><strong>POST</strong> /order</p>
<p>must include JSON payload described in the schema below. The <em>url</em> in the response can be used to check the status.</p>
<p>responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>201 - order created</li>
<li>400 - invalid request</li>
</ul>
<p>example response:</p>
<p><code>json
{
    "message": "extract request 03917a0b-898c-4d26-8f88-f3305a29b878 created.",
    "url": "https://q81rej0j12.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/order/03917a0b-898c-4d26-8f88-f3305a29b878"
}</code></p>
<p><strong>GET</strong> /order/:id</p>
<p>must include the order id in the request path</p>
<p>responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>200 - success</li>
<li>400 - no order id provided</li>
<li>404 - invalid order id provided</li>
</ul>
